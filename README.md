# Python interfaces for CoDrone

Codes work with CoDrone pro - https://www.robolink.com/codrone/

<h3>CoDrone pro has 2 programming interfaces - </h3>
Python - <br>
coDrone library works with BLE conection (BLE shield in coDrone kit)<br>
petrone library works over Wifi connection (Wifi module in coDrone FPV kit)<br><br>
Arduino - <br>
coDrone pro remote is Arduino board - Connects to coDrone using BLE shield
<br>

<h3>Drone control</h3>
Drone motion can be controlled using coDrone library http://dev-support.robolink.com/<br>
Python notebook contains sample code for pairing, controlling the drone

<h3>Drone video streaming</h3>
coDrone FPV module needed for streaming video. Programatic access possible using rtps connection. <br>
OpenCV sample video capture code in notebook. RTPS connection allows gives frame by frame images.
